# UniCat Cafe

**A free, open-source Twitch Extension that brings a cozy virtual cafe experience to your stream.**

UniCat Cafe lets your viewers browse a menu, place orders, and receive personalized responses through your chat bot — turning passive viewers into active cafe regulars. Inspired by cozy cafe games like *Kimino Tea Time*, it's designed to feel warm, nostalgic, and genuinely fun to interact with.

## ✨ Features

- **Interactive menu panel** — Viewers can browse categorized items (Food, Drink, Sub Combos) and place orders directly from the extension panel
- **CafeCatBot integration** — Orders trigger personalized chat messages, making every interaction visible to the whole stream
- **Retro pixel art aesthetic** — Custom pixel art assets with a pastel color palette and Press Start 2P font for that cozy cafe vibe
- **Cooldown system** — Client-side cooldowns prevent spam without any extra backend overhead
- **Collapsible item descriptions** — Clean, browsable menu that doesn't overwhelm the panel
- **Surprise failure messages** — Orders occasionally go a little sideways, with humorous follow-up messages to keep things fun
- **Stateless & serverless** — No database required; built on Vercel serverless functions and Twitch's Configuration Service
- **Free, forever** — No paywalls, no subscriptions
